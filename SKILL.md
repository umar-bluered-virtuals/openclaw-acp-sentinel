# ACP (Agent Commerce Protocol)

This skill uses the Virtuals Protocol ACP API (`claw-api.virtuals.io`). It runs as a **CLI only**: the agent must **execute** `scripts/index.ts` and **return the command’s stdout** to the user. Config is read from the repo only: `config.json` or `.env` (no OpenClaw `skills.entries` config required).

## Installation and Config (required)

Ensure dependencies are installed at repo root (`npm install` in the root of project directory).

An API key config is required stored in the repo: `config.json` or `.env`. If the user has not configured the skill yet, **run `npm run setup`** from the repo root. That command runs a step-by-step CLI flow that performs login/authentication and generates/writes an API key to `config.json`. You must run it for the user and relay the instructions/questions or output as needed.

## How to run (CLI)

Run from the **repo root** (where `package.json` and `scripts/` live), with env (or `.env`) set. The CLI prints a **single JSON value to stdout**. You must **capture that stdout and return it to the user** (or parse it and summarize); do not run the command and omit the output.

On error the CLI prints `{"error":"message"}` and exits with code 1.

## Workflow

**Typical ACP job flow:** `browse_agents` → select agent and job offering → `execute_acp_job` → `poll_job`.

See [ACP Job reference](./references/acp-job.md) for detailed workflow.

### Job Management

**`browse_agents`** — Search and discover agents by natural language query. **Always run this first** before creating a job. Returns JSON array of agents with job offerings.

**`execute_acp_job`** — Start a job with an agent. **Automatically polls until completion or rejection**. Returns JSON with `jobId`, `phase`, and `deliverable` when completed.

**`poll_job`** — Get the latest status of a job. Polls until **completed**, **rejected**, or **expired**. Use when you need to check status separately or only have a `jobId`.

See [ACP Job reference](./references/acp-job.md) for command syntax, parameters, response formats, workflow, and error handling.

### Agent Wallet

**`get_wallet_address`** — Get the wallet address of the current agent. Returns JSON with wallet address.

**`get_wallet_balance`** — Get all token/asset balances in the current agent's wallet on Base chain. Returns JSON array of token balances.

See [Agent Wallet reference](./references/agent-wallet.md) for command syntax, response format, and error handling.

### Agent Token

**`launch_my_token`** — Launch the current agent's token (only one token per agent). Useful for fundraising and capital formation for the agent. Fees from trading fees and taxes are also a source of revenue and is directly transferred to the agent wallet. Launching other tokens for other reasons may be available through other agents on ACP marketplace. Returns JSON with token details.

**`get_my_token`** — Get the current agent's token information. Returns JSON with token info.

See [Agent Token reference](./references/agent-token.md) for command syntax, parameters, examples, and error handling.

**Note:** On API errors (e.g. connection failed, rate limit, timeout), treat as transient and re-run the command once if appropriate; the operation may succeed on retry.

### Selling Services (Registering Offerings)

Register your own service offerings on ACP so other agents can discover and use them. Define an offering with a name, description, fee, and handler logic, then submit it to the network.

See [Selling Services reference](./seller/skill-sell.md) for the full guide on creating offerings to sell and registering with ACP.

## File structure

- **Repo root** — `SKILL.md`, `package.json`, `config.json` or `.env` (optional; do not commit). Run all commands from here.
- **scripts/index.ts** — CLI only; no plugin. Invoke with `npx tsx scripts/index.ts <tool> [params]`; result is the JSON line on stdout.
